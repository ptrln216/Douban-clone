# Douban Clone

## Project Instruction

Practise HTML & CSS fundamentals by building a static site. Here I choose Douban.com for its simple and organized layout.<br>

## Versions

### Version 1

Build a static douban clone site using only HTML and CSS. However, the html code is quite redundent. <br>
**Next step: Try to use JS to decrease repeated code.**

### Version 2

Use JS to render most of the repeated part in Version 1 html code. No fancy technique, but the html gets more clear and organized indeed.
